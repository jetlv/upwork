See details in attached text. In your bid please describe how long it will take and tell me how you plan
to avoid captcha show / endless redirects like it happens if call CURL.
All bids without qualified explanations will be ignored.

===============================================

I need code in PHP/Node.js to login on upwork site and get jobs keeping logged in.
No need parse data, just login and save html to file.
Details:

https://www.upwork.com/login
Enter your login and password, select Remember me and click Login.

Then go to
https://www.upwork.com/jobs/?spellcheck=1&highlight=1&sortBy=s_ctime+desc&cn1%5B%5D=Web%2C+Mobile+%26+Software+Dev&cn2%5B%5D=Web+Development&cn2%5B%5D=Other+-+Software+Development&cn2%5B%5D=Desktop+Software+Development&cn2%5B%5D=Scripts+%26+Utilities&exp%5B%5D=2&exp%5B%5D=3&amount%5B%5D=Min&amount%5B%5D=1k

It should show jobs list and keep logged in, so when visit any job details I see hire details in html.
